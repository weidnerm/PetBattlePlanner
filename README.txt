This is an addon for world of warcraft to support pet battles.

As trainers are battled, the addon learns the trainer and their pets.
The enemy pets and their abilities can be viewed and compared against 
the players pet collection.  The player pets are grouped into a matrix
that summarizes defense strenght and offense strength against the selected
trainer pet.  

When a good pet match has been selected, it can be assigned to a slot to 
pair it with the selected enemy.  The player's 3 pet team can be built up
and will be remembered.  

Once the player team is known and associated with a trainer, it can be
restored by targeting the trainer and clicking the player team in the 
gui.
